# NEXT MOVIE

After a long time i want to introduce THE NEXT MOVIE, Your IMDB Alternative


# What IS NEXT MOVIE?
Next Movie Is a IMDB alternative that is built with next js (And this is the reason why its called next movie).

Next Movie uses TMDB API and almost all of this app is running with tmdb api,from sliders to image galleries.

## Why and how it is created
After i finished my front end learning i thought to myself that i need to create an ultimate web application that covers all of my abilites so next movie came into my mind (because i wanted to build something like this on other programming languages as well.)
So i searched on the internet and first i found tmdb api that covered my needs and then i found [this](https://www.figma.com/design/nfnhvUdS3WaV1mMo8UBkDF/Saintstream-Movie-Streaming-Website-%28Community%29?node-id=18-2808) free template on figma and i tried to recreate it.
Also i added some components and pages by myself.

## What UI libraries did i use?

Tailwind,Next UI (for some ui components not all of them), and swiper for production (because my slider needs some works for now)

# How can i run it?
First get an api key from tmdb and put it inside .env file and name it NEXT_PUBLIC_API_KEY and then run this command

    npm install
Then after you make sure all of the dependencies installed you can run this command

    npm run dev

# Some Pics From Ui

I Will Add them later
